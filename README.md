# API Endpoints
- To see a list of databases, run: `psql`
  - type \l
  - to exit `q`
    `exit`

Point of communication 
- Get a request from your route which will call on your controller method
- Send json as data since we are working on an API

Practice TDD - write tests, fail, write code, pass
Tests are written in spec/requests/cats_spec.rb for our request specs
